People shouldn't have guns - guns are bad.
Guns are great, everyone should be able to get their hands on them.
The shooting at monterey park for lunar new year was awful, so many innocent lives taken. 
Guns should be controlled. all these shootings in 2023 already prove it!
Guns shouldn't be controlled - its america everyone should be able to do what they want.
