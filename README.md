# Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Gun Control

## Introduction
This project is on the sentiment analysis of tweets regarding the topic of gun control. In recent years in the United States, there have been an outburst of several horrific events as a result of guns getting in the hands of the wrong people. In 2023, the number of mass shootings in the US has already reached triple digits. With these incidents, we believe it would be an interesting study to do further research into the sentiment and beliefs that people have toward these issues and study this using automation and machine learning. Twitter is a very vocal platform and with the use of our new knowledge regarding sentiment analysis, there are possibly very many interesting discoveries to be made, such as how user sentiment toward one topic may differ from another. We hypothesize that because of the many gruesome events that have occurred in recent years, we will observe a mostly positive sentiment toward gun control, in that people support more regulation of weapon distribution rather than less. Our proposed project period of 10 weeks can be attributed to the fact that we are looking to improve upon our previous work by expanding our knowledge on the Astra Streaming features, and working on more efficient implementation of our architecture to ensure that we receive enough data for sufficient analysis.  We will also look to go further by integrating new features into our project, including displaying results from our visualizations on a website in addition to streaming data to a feature store or database. As we work towards these goals, we recognize that we may come across technical issues that may require us to be more flexible and adjust our project structure, so we would like to stay open minded in regards to what additional features will be added.
