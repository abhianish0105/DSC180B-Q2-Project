<p>
In this ever growing period of chaos where gun violence seems to be spiraling out of control, it is important to consider the opinions of people who live in cities and communities affected by this epidemic. There is most likely no solution that would make everyone happy, but through sentiment analysis, the general opinions can be deduced and even used to influence these impactful decisions. Twitter is a microblogging and social media platform that has amassed an enormous platform of around 206 million daily active users that account for approximately 500 million tweets per day. This popularity can be attributed to the fact that users feel enabled to talk freely about virtually anything they want, including their daily lives or topics that they are passionate about. With this kind of presence, it is only natural that the controversial topic of gun control became a huge subject matter due to recent tragic events.
