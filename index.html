<h4 id="Topic Assignment">Topic Assignment</a></h4>
Starting from the far left, alpha is a hyperparameter that determines how concentrated the topics are. Would a random Wikipedia document discuss many topics, or would it focus on a small number of topics? Typically, it does not make sense that a document would talk about everything under the sun, and so we will expect some concentration of topics as a good author is wise to focus his or her energies.<br><br>

Next, based on alpha and the Dirichlet distribution, each document receives its own theta value which determines the overall proportion of topics in the document. (We can see now that we have D thetas as we enter the rectangle marked D) Perhaps one theta value might be 50% “health” and 50% “food”, if the article is about the healing ability of good cooking!<br><br>

Next, based on theta and the multinomial distribution, each word in every document receives its own topic assignment, making D x N assignments in total. The model is a bag of words, so the ordering does not matter. Based on our previous example of 50% “health” and 50% “food”, each word would be flipping a coin and getting exactly only one of those assignments.

We spent a lot of time discussing how to infer the latent parameters of LDA. The final output that is actually of most interest is the topic vocab or beta. We ran our experiment on documents from Wikipedia and here are the vocabularies of the first two topics.
<p><img src="./images/Topics1.png" alt="Topics1" /></p>
The first topic above appears to be about storybooks, as you can see from the relative frequencies of “story”, “book” and “character” which appear with higher probability than other documents on different topics.
<p><img src="./images/Topics2.png" alt="Topics2" /></p>
The second topic above appears to be about the geography of a village or town.
